#Day 3 - Phython Loops
 This Folder contains my Day 3 practice work focused  on Phythons Loops and repetition 
 ## Concepts Practiced 
 - `for` loops
 - `while` loops
 - `range()`
 - Conditional Logic inside loops
 - Repetition and retry Logic
## Files
-`loop_basics.py` - basic `for` loop and range
- `even _odd_checker.py - checls whether number are even or add
- `password_retry .py` - password retry system using a `while` loop
- religion_checker.py - input handling with conditional logic
  Each file runs independently and demonstrates a single concept.
